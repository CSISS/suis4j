SUIS (simple universal interface of service) java library

# Introduction

The disparate interfaces of web-based spatial information and analysis services cause very high barrier of entry. Simple Universal Interface of Service (SUIS) is invented to facilitate the use of heterogeneous web services in Earth science application. SUIS addresses to hide the technical details such as protocols, styles, bindings, schemas and addresses. An enhanced service-oriented framework is created to map the disparate interfaces into SUIS. 

A Java library is developed to support the automatic mapping from/to SOAP, OGC and REST services. SUIS aims to be extremely simple for entry-level consumers. With SUIS, users could be relieved from learning and communicating with all sorts of interfaces. Importantly, this work does not intend to replace the existing interfaces but supplement with an easier one to proxy them. 

A prototype excises SUIS and builds geoprocessing workflows over it.

The tutorial of suis4j library:

## generate a suis request

## generate a suis response

## transform suis request to OGC WPS request

## transform suis request to SOAP request

## transform suis request to RESTful request
